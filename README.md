##What's this?

I'm running a simple class to help get people who work in HubSpot's Dublin offices up to speed with basic programming - arming all teams (sales, services, support, etc.) with powerful skills that will help them in their day-to-day, and in the future.

##Lesson One
This is the first of many lessons where we go through the basics of HTML, CSS and web technologies.
